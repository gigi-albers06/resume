Motivation:
Solar storms are huge space weather events that disturb Earth’s magnetic field, creating geophysical hazards that affect satellites, power systems, and national (and eleven international) communication. Understanding how the Sun’s energy transfers through space and interacts with Earth connects space geophysics and Earth geophysics. Our motivation is to understand the physical relationship between solar activity and Earth’s magnetic response, measured and visualized with real geophysical data.

Question and Hypothesis:
How does Earth’s magnetic field respond during solar storm events, and how closely are magnetic disturbances related to changes in solar wind conditions? We hypothesize that periods with high solar wind speed and stronger solar magnetic field activity will relate to larger disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field.

How are we going to answer/test:
We will compare solar wind data with Earth's magnetic field disturbance data over the same time periods, and then analyze correlations in both timing and intensity. Creating time series plots and visualizations will help identify patterns and relationships between solar storm activity and Earth’s magnetic response.

Types of data and potential public data repositories:
OMNI dataset: Solar wind speed, density, and magnetic field data.
DSCOVR: Solar wind measurements.
KP index from NOAA: Geomagnetic disturbance indices
SuperMAG: Ground magnetometer measurements of Earth’s magnetic field.
